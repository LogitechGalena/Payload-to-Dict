# Payload-to-Dict
A simple script to convert request payloads to json dictionaries.

You can use this however you'd like. I just ask that you credit me somewhere in it. ðŸ™‚

## How to Install:

Open up the command prompt and navigate to the folder in which convert.py is located.
Run the following in the command prompt:

```
pip install requests
```

This will install all the needed modules to run the script.

```
python convert.py
```
That's all you need! Just type in the state you live in (NJ, VA, etc.) and it will search for available vaccines.
